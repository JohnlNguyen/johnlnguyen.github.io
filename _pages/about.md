I am a research engineer at Meta AI (FAIR), working multimodal models. My research interests include multimodal generation and understanding. I served on the organizing committee for FL-ICML, the program committee for FL-NeurIPS, and reviewer for ICLR, ICML, NeurIPS, AISTATS, and MLSys.
  
Before Meta, I graduated Cum Laude from UC Davis with double majors in Statistics and Computer Science (2018) and M.S. in Computer Science (2019). At UC Davis, I worked with Prem Devanbu and Vincent Hellendoorn on empirical software engineering.
